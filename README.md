# Simple Linear Regression from Scratch

This repository contains a Python implementation of simple linear regression without using any external libraries like scikit-learn or statsmodels. The goal is to understand the underlying mathematics by implementing the algorithm from scratch.

## Description

Linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables. This implementation uses the least squares method to find the best fit line that predicts a dependent variable based on an independent variable.
